                This year's theme it's a bold declaration that challenges the boundaries of what technology can achieve and reimagines who shapes its future.

                    We stand at a pivotal moment where AI is transforming our world‚Äîbringing unprecedented opportunities but also risking the amplification of gender biases and systemic barriers.
                    As artificial intelligence becomes woven into society, we believe that women are not just participating in its development‚Äîthey're revolutionizing it, breaking conventions, and 
                    expanding the horizons of what technology can and should be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The future of technology isn't predetermined‚Äî it is something we actively shape. 
                    What seems impossible today becomes tomorrow‚Äôs reality when we dare to challenge it.
