                            Pisa's railway station (Pisa Centrale) is directly connected with Turin, Rome, Genova and
                            Milan. There are frequent connections with the Florence main station (Firenze Santa Maria
                            Novella) that you can reach with a high-speed train (Freccia Rossa).

                            Pisa has an international airport with daily flights to London and Munich, as well as to
                            Rome, Milan, and other important Italian cities.

                            The airport is approximately 3 km from the center. The most convenient way to reach the
                            center is probably by taxi. Taxis are located near the "Arrivals" exit of the air terminal.
                            If there is no taxi out there, you may call the <a href="http://www.cotapi.it/en/"

                            As an alternative you can take the <a href="http://pisa-mover.com/en/">Pisa Mover</a>, a
                            city train that connects Pisa Airport to Pisa Railway Station (Pisa Centrale), then walk to

                            is a bit of a problem and most parking areas are with pay-meters.
