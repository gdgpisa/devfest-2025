## Celebrating International Women's Day at DevFest Pisa 2025! 🌟

Hello everyone! 👋 We're thrilled to announce that we'll be celebrating International Women's Day (IWD) at DevFest Pisa 2025! 💪👩‍💻

For GDG Pisa, diversity and inclusion are topics that are particularly close to our hearts ❤️. We firmly believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of gender, age, or background.

In collaboration with the Women Techmakers group of Pisa, we've decided to celebrate IWD during our DevFest with a dedicated track: the IWD track! 🎉

This track will focus on women in tech, diversity, inclusion, and soft skills. We hope to inspire you and make your DevFest experience even more enriching! ✨

**What to expect? 🤔**

* Networking opportunities with industry professionals 🤝
* Discussions on promoting inclusivity in the tech world 📣

Don't forget to get your ticket as soon as possible, seats are limited and they're going fast! 🎟️😄
