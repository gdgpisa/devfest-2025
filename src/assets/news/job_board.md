Hi everyone,

It's time to announce the comeback of a very popular feature of DevFest: the job board!

If your company is recruiting or if you're looking for new opportunities, you will probably be interested in reading more about this.

You can use the job board to post job openings for your company and advertise your open positions, but please pay attention to the following rules as we want to make this event as enjoyable as possible for all participants.

### What is allowed:

* Posting of job openings related to IT development.
* Posting of job openings related to system administration/DevOps/data analysis.
* Posting of job openings related to design/product management.
* Posting of job openings related to engineering management.
* Posting of business cards.
* Leaving gadgets/swag on the table next to the board.
* Passive recruitment (Posting only).
* Using posts with a maximum format of A4.


### What is NOT allowed:

* Active recruitment (inviting people to look at your job).
* Handing out flyers.
* Using posts with a format bigger than A4.
* Posting jobs on top of other jobs.
* Posting of openings with missing information.
